/*
 * When a reminder is due, and what it says (#154).
 *
 * Desktop reminders exist only while Kutumb is open: there is no tray, no login item, and no
 * process running once the window is closed. What that buys back is the same-day catch-up --
 * somebody who opens the app once a week still gets today's reminder the moment they do, because
 * `dueNow` asks "is it past nine, and have we not already told them today" rather than "did an
 * alarm fire at nine sharp". It also means turning the switch off needs no scheduler to cancel:
 * `dueNow` simply returns null while `reminders` is false, so off is off at once, everywhere this
 * gets called from (`renderer/app.js`'s `checkReminders`, on startup, on a tree opening, on the
 * window regaining focus, and on a 15-minute interval robust to the machine having slept through a
 * shorter one).
 *
 * Pure, and deliberately not read against the wall clock itself: `now` is passed in, so the tests
 * can hold it still and the smoke harness can move only the hour -- `FTREE_SMOKE_REMINDER_HOUR`,
 * read in `preload.js` and applied in `app.js`'s `remindersClock` -- without lying about the date a
 * "birthday today" assertion depends on.
 *
 * A port of nothing in particular: Android's half of #154 schedules through `AlarmManager`, which
 * this app has no equivalent of and does not want one, precisely because "while Kutumb is open" is
 * the whole design. What is shared is the wording, kept identical by eye against the phone's
 * strings so a family member switching devices reads the same sentence either way.
